# Work Log

## 2024-12-19 - Session 1: MCP Server Refactoring & Git Workflow Enhancement

### Date & Session Summary
Successfully refactored the MCP server implementation from legacy MCP to FastMCP 2.0.0, cleaned up dependencies, removed unused code, and enhanced git workflow capabilities. Also implemented a comprehensive work logging system for better session continuity.

### Code Changes

#### Server Implementation (`ericmjl_productivity_mcp/server.py`)
- **Migrated to FastMCP 2.0.0**: Replaced legacy MCP server implementation with FastMCP decorator-based API
- **Updated decorator syntax**: Changed from `@mcp.tool` to `@mcp.tool()` (parentheses required in FastMCP 2.0.0)
- **Added new prompts**:
  - `git_branch_and_stage()`: Comprehensive prompt for creating git branches and staging changes
  - `log_progress()`: Structured work logging system for session continuity
- **Removed prompts**: Eliminated `daily_reflection()` and `focus_session()` as they weren't aligned with development workflow needs
- **Maintained existing functionality**: Kept `task_prioritization()`, `remember()`, and all resource/tool functions

#### Dependency Management (`pyproject.toml`)
- **Pinned FastMCP version**: Set to exactly `fastmcp==2.0.0` to avoid compatibility issues
- **Pinned Pydantic version**: Set to `pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` (v3 not available in conda-forge)
- **Removed unused dependencies**: Cleaned up unnecessary packages
- **Commented out CUDA feature**: Removed as no longer relevant to current project

#### Project Structure Cleanup
- **Removed unused modules**: Deleted `models.py`, `preprocessing.py`, `schemas.py` (no longer needed with FastMCP)
- **Updated pixi.lock**: Reflected new dependency set and removed unused packages

#### Git Configuration (`.gitignore`)
- **Added `.llamabot/` directory**: Prevents tracking of LlamaBot message logs
- **Removed database file**: Successfully removed `.llamabot/message_log.db` from git history

### Problem Solving

#### FastMCP Version Compatibility Issues
- **Challenge**: FastMCP 2.10.6+ had Pydantic compatibility bugs (tried to define fields with both `default` and `default_factory`)
- **Solution**: Downgraded to FastMCP 2.0.0 which works reliably with Pydantic v2
- **Key insight**: Always check actual error messages rather than assuming compatibility problems

#### Git History Cleanup
- **Challenge**: `.llamabot/message_log.db` was tracked in git and needed removal
- **Solution**: Used `git rm --cached` to remove from tracking, added `.llamabot/` to `.gitignore`
- **Process**: Unstaged changes → removed file from tracking → updated gitignore → restaged remaining changes

#### Prompt Design Evolution
- **Challenge**: Original productivity prompts (`daily_reflection`, `focus_session`) weren't suitable for development workflow
- **Solution**: Replaced with `log_progress()` prompt focused on session continuity and development context
- **Design principle**: Focus on actionable continuity rather than general productivity advice

### Key Learnings

#### FastMCP Best Practices
- FastMCP 2.0.0 requires decorators to be called with parentheses: `@mcp.tool()`, `@mcp.prompt()`, `@mcp.resource()`
- FastMCP handles event loops internally - use `mcp.run()` directly instead of `asyncio.run()`
- Version 2.0.0 is stable and reliable for production use

#### Git Workflow Patterns
- Use `git rm --cached` to remove files from tracking without deleting them locally
- Always update `.gitignore` when removing files to prevent future tracking
- Staging changes separately allows for selective commits

#### MCP Server Architecture
- FastMCP provides cleaner, more maintainable code than legacy MCP
- Decorator-based API is more intuitive and less error-prone
- Resource and tool functions work seamlessly with FastMCP

### Next Steps

#### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test the MCP server**: Verify all prompts, tools, and resources work correctly with FastMCP 2.0.0
2. **Document API**: Update documentation to reflect FastMCP implementation
3. **Add more development-focused prompts**: Consider prompts for code review, debugging, or testing

#### Future Enhancements
1. **HTTP transport**: Implement HTTP transport option (currently only stdio works)
2. **Auto-reload**: Add development auto-reload functionality
3. **Random port**: Implement random port selection for HTTP transport
4. **More git workflows**: Add prompts for merge strategies, conflict resolution, etc.

#### Development Workflow
1. **Use pixi commands**: Always use `pixi run` prefix for commands
2. **Maintain AGENTS.md**: Continue updating with learnings and preferences
3. **Use WORKLOG.md**: Document progress at end of each session for continuity

### Context Notes

#### Project State
- **Current branch**: `main` (all changes committed)
- **Dependencies**: FastMCP 2.0.0, Pydantic 2.x, pixi for management
- **Architecture**: Single-file server implementation with decorator-based API
- **Transport**: Currently stdio-only, HTTP transport planned

#### User Preferences
- Prefers auto-reload enabled for development
- Prefers random port selection instead of default port 8000
- Uses pixi for dependency management
- Values session continuity and comprehensive documentation

#### Technical Decisions
- Chose FastMCP 2.0.0 over newer versions for stability
- Removed unused modules to simplify codebase
- Focused prompts on development workflow rather than general productivity
- Implemented comprehensive logging system for better session management
